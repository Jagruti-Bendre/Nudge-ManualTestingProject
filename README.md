# Nudge-ManualTestingProject
The Nudge-ManualTestingProject focuses on testing Nudge, an activity tracking app designed to enhance focus and mindfulness. Users can choose from 80+ activities like audiobook listening or cooking, set durations, and receive customizable pop-up reminders asking, "Are you still focused?" Activities engage senses like sight, taste, and hearing.
